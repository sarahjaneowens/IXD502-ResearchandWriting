       <blockquote style="color: #1cc9ac;">"When we brand things, our brains perceive them as more special and valuable than they actually are."</blockquote> <cite> - Martin Lindstrom</cite>

        <p class="text"> Before I ever picked up a marketing book, I had a slight inkling that there was some form of psychology used in the process of marketing.  However, never to the extent that I do now. Aside from the creative side of marketing, this is what drew me to research this topic. I have always wondered why people act the way they do and what drives them make the choices they make. I'm curious to know why I prefer a certain product over others and why I enjoy some advertisements on TV, whilst disliking others. How much marketing and psychology overlap is a debatable topic, but for me, there's no debate. My opinion is that it is probably impossible to carry out a successful marketing campaign without the use of psychology as a major participant.</p>

<p class="text">Through research that I have carried out, I want to highlight when and how psychological factors such as behavioural psychology and cognitive psychology have impacted the process of digital marketing through human decision making. I will also explain that in order to make decision making effective within digital marketing there is a need to induce compromises to meet business objectives. I will clearly demonstrate the link between marketing and psychology as evident. Whilst, understanding consumers' behaviour and the underlying motivation behind the way the human mind is influenced to make specific choices.
