        <p class="text">To conclude my opinion, Digital marketing is a combination of marketing and psychological elements that merge together to influence consumers behaviour and thought process. This can only be achieved by having a clear understanding of how people think and how these thoughts affect how they act. Psychology has become a major part of digital advertising. Online marketers try to discover all the unseen factors of human nature, which might be helpful in attracting the attention of your customer base.
