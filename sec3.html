<p class="text">Now that I have explained what digital marketing and psychology are and what they both entail. Can you now start to notice why digital marketers need to use elements of cognitive-behavioural psychology to accomplish their intended aim?  To reinforce my opinion, as the term marketing is defined as a “Social Process” by Kolter and Armstrong, Social processes are solely revolved around behaviour. Behaviour is conducted through conditioned psychology. When applying the science of psychology into specific digital marketing strategies, it will ensure its effectiveness throughout marketing campaigns. Therefore marketers will only achieve a successful campaign by “getting into the mind” of the consumer.</p> 

        <p class="text">Digital marketing is concerned with finding ways to satisfy their target audiences needs, wants and desires, through the use of digital technology. It concentrates on trying to determine what stimulates consumer decision making.  Marketing Author, Martin windstorm makes the point that “First we need to remember that all human beings are irrational and make their decisions with their emotions.” Therefore it is of great importance for marketers to understand what is provoking and motivating the consumer's emotional responses. This is when psychology comes into the picture, as this helps marketers understand who is engaging with their content and why. </p>

<p class="text">Businesses need to understand the customer from a psychological perspective in order to understand their characteristics or qualities and how they view things in the world. This means moving beyond basic demographics and behavioural patterns to understand psychographics. We need to start understanding the customer's emotional triggers and then using that information to create content that is relevant to them.  To be able to understand an individual's personality triggers along with their purchase behaviour is one of the most important aspects of successful digital marketing. </p>   

        <p class="text">Using customers online purchase history will provide all the quality information that a marketing team will ever need to understand their customer's behavioural patterns. Thus merging these vital motivational insights and psychographics provides marketers with accurate data statistics, enabling them to make the best decisions around digital marketing strategies that they can include in their content such as personalisation. I believe that customised content creates a better connection with your target audience, as it makes them feel important and valued. In fact, from the research I discovered that 75% of customers are more motivated to buy from companies that not only know their name but also makes recommendations based on previous purchases. </p>

        <p class="text">By understanding some key principles of psychology can take businesses digital marketing to a whole new level. Psychology Professor, Robert Rosenthal wrote an article for Fast Company which stated that “the majority of marketers aren’t psychologists…Smart and skillful marketers use psychology to attract and engage consumers, compelling them to buy.”</p>

        <h3>Persuasion Principles</h3>

        <p class="text">Dr. Robert Cialdini, a marketing and psychology professor suggests that people use past decisions to determine their future actions. In 1984, Cialdini released his book called ‘ Influence: The psychology of persuasion,’ which consists of his six principles of persuasion, scarcity, reciprocity, social proof, authority, liking and commitment/consistency. </p>
       
        
        <p class="text">These key principles have been used throughout digital advertising for over 30 years now. This is because the key to successful digital marketing is the use of psychological persuasion, which is what these 6 principles involve. “The next time a browser merely visits your website, you want to turn him into a shopper and then a definite buyer.” However, In my opinion along with some of Dr. Cialdini’s key principles like Social proof, scarcity, and reciprocity, I feel that there are other important persuasion techniques that definitely make a difference when it comes to a successful digital marketing campaign, such as priming and anchoring and I will explain why I believe that. </p>


        <h4>PRIMING</h4>

        <p class="text">Humans are very influential. Research shows that if we read one thing, it will affect the way we respond to the next thing. This is known as priming. Priming is when you are exposed to certain words or images that may influence our thinking without us being aware that our brain is associating the two stimuli together. When we think about well-known brands, we always associate the tagline and brand together as one because that's what we have been exposed to. For example, ‘Coca-Cola’ is priming consumers by using the word ‘Enjoy’ within their branding, therefore psychologically your brain will tell that you will enjoy this drink, so you react and buy it. Apple's brand also primes their consumers through their branding by including the tagline ‘Think Different.' This form of priming is portraying the idea to individuals that if you purchase Apple's products or if you use their products, you will be unique, standing out from the crowd. Therefore our brains perceive this as a good thing, subjecting our brains to want to purchase Apple's products.  </p>  

        <h4>RECIPROCITY</h4> 

        <p class="text">Reciprocity is basically the idea that when someone does something positive for you, you will naturally want to do something nice in return. We can't help but feel that way, It is a social norm for you to feel obligated to return the favour. The tactic of reciprocity is used as a persuasion technique within digital marketing. This technique is known as the “that's not all” approach. For example, if you go to purchase a new laptop and the salesperson explains the price to you, but you're still not quite sure about purchasing it. If that salesperson was to offer you a laptop bag at no additional cost, you might feel obligated to go through with the purchase because it feels like they have done you a favour by giving you an extra item for free. When in fact, it’s just a persuasion technique salespeople are trained to use to get people to buy their products or services. </p> 

        

        <blockquote style="color:#4e99ff;">“We view a behaviour as more correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it.” <cite class="cite-rob">- Dr. Robert Cialdini </cite> </blockquote>
        
        <h4>SOCIAL PROOF</h4>
        
        <p class="text">Have you ever noticed when people copy or are influenced by others to participate in certain behaviours because they think why not, everyone else is doing it? That is known as Social Proof. No one likes to feel left out, therefore individuals being apart of the ‘buzz’ gives them a sense of belonging and importance because they are apart of something regardless of what it could be. So when Businesses include this within their digital marketing strategies they want their consumers to take part in their behaviours, that will hopefully generate sales. For example, when there is a new toy craze at Christmas, a child tells their parents that all their friends are getting this new toy. However, this new toy has been selling out in stores and online consistantly. Some parents will go to the ends of the earth to get that latest toy, to make sure their child doesn’t feel left out amongst their friends. </p>

        <h4>SCARCITY</h4> 

        <p class="text">Using scarcity in marketing techniques creates a sense of exclusivity. This can create a sense of urgency and importance through time-based scarcity. So it's basically if you receive an email from your favourite clothing company with the subjectline "Don't Miss out! 50% off everything, ending soon!" The customer is more than likely going to click on that link and make purchases because their brain is telling them that this deal is too good to miss out on. One of the best examples of retailers using scarcity in their digital marketing is during Cyber Monday. On Cyber Monday 2017, Amazon processed more than 8 million transactions and got nearly 60% of total Cyber Monday sales and saw 103 million visits. This conveys how powerful scarcity is during the Cyber Monday Sales.  Using 'FOMO', the Fear of missing out technique within digital marketing strategies, can be a powerful motivator for customers, particularly in e-commerce. It makes customers think that they will regret it if they don’t buy these items, as Cyber Monday only comes around once a year.</p>

         <h4>ANCHORING </h4>

        <p class="text">Can you remember a time when you have bought an item just because it was on sale and when you compared it to the original price it was too good of a deal to miss out on? If so, then you were influenced into making that decision through a digital marketing technique called Anchoring.  When individuals try to make decisions, they usually use an “anchor” as a starting point. Anchoring is a cognitive bias. This term was discovered by cognitive-behavioural psychologists to describe how humans are prone to rely on the first piece of information they are told about something. That means any additional or new information they may have discovered will be automatically weighed up against the first. Advertisers use anchoring techniques to persuade customers into making a final decision on a product they may be interested in. Overall will result in higher conversions. </p>
